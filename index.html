Hi, My name is Jacob tate.  I live in the mountains near dunlap tn.
I love doing anything outdoors! Hunting, fishing, trapping, hiking
you name it. I also have worked at my Dads restaurant since i was 15.
I play video games too. That made Me wonder how they worked.

I decided to try My hand at coding and took an online corse.
When it was finished I enrolled in this program.
